Problem Solving And Coding Patterns - Coding Fluency and Problem Solving
Problem-solving: A problem is a question for which you have no idea (at least initially) what method will work. You will feel clueless at the beginning. Problems are not exercises. 
	Example exercise: 3456789 X 43289763 = ? It is hard, but there is no doubt what method to use. 
	A problem requires sustained investigation, deploying problem-solving strategies.
		1) Mathematical problems
		2) Scientific problems
		3) Computational problems.* 

Coding Patterns/Algorithm Design Strategies/Problem Solving Strategies that we have learnt in Foundational Class for Sorting are: 
	Brute Force
	Decrease and Conquer
	Divide and Conquer
	Transform and Conquer

We are focusing on the computational problems: 
	The intent of an ideal technical interview is to come up with an algorithm and implement it.
		An algorithm is the step by step method to solve a computational problem.
		We implement an algorithm as a program.
	Intent of an ideal technical interview: Can you design a correct and efficient algorithm that solves the problem, and code it up?
	These tests our problem-solving skills, our coding skills and our knowledge of computer science and engineering fundamentals.
		Live Classes with IK will help us in:
			Problem-solving skills
			Coding skills
		Foundational Videos will help us with:
			Computer Science And Engineering Fundamentals
			
Interviews Causes Anxiety:
	How do we tackle the tension between problem-solving (which needs time) and a severe time limit?
