What are System Design Fundamentals? 
	There are 4 categories of System Design Fundamentals:
		Underlying Foundational System Design Knowledge: e.g. Client Server Model, Network Protocols
		Key Characteristics of System Design: e.g. 
			1) Availability: What is system availability? System availability (also known as equipment availability or asset availability) is a metric that measures the probability that a system is not failed or undergoing a repair action when it needs to be used. There are three qualifications that need to be met for a system to be available: 
				a) Functioning equipment: Not out of service for repairs or inspections.
				b) Functioning under normal conditions: Operates in an ideal setting at an expected rate.
				c) Functioning when needed: Operational at any time production is scheduled
				System availability is used to gauge if an asset’s production potential is being maximized, which has a direct impact on the financial health of a business. It is measure in Nines. 
				Availability %				Downtime Per Year		Downtime Per Month		Downtime Per Week
				90%(One Nine)				36.5 Days				72 Hours				16.5 Hours
				99%(Two Nines)				3.65 Days				7.20 Hours				1.68 Hours
				99.5%(Two And Half Nines)	1.83 Days				3.60 Hours				50.4 Minutes
				99.9%(Three Nines)			8.76 Hours				43.8 Minutes			10.1 Minutes
				99.95%						4.38 Hours				21.56 Minutes			5.04 Minutes
				99.99%(Four Nines)			52.56 Minutes			4.32 Minutes			1.01 Minutes
				99.999%(Five Nines)			5.26 Minutes			25.9 Seconds			6.05 Seconds
				99.9999%(Six Nines)			31.5 Seconds			2.59 Seconds			0.605 Seconds
				99.99999%(Seven Nines)		3.15 Seconds			0.259 Seconds			0.0605 Seconds
			In order to ensure Availability do horizontal Scaling with replication.

		Actual Components in System Design: e.g.
			1) Load Balancers
			2) Proxies
			3) Caches
			4) Rate Limiting
			5) Leader Election
		Actual Tech: e.g.
			1) Zookeper
			2) ETCD
			3) NGINX
			4) REDIS
			5) Amazon S3
			6) Google Cloud Storage

Client Server Model:
	Client: A machine or process that requests data or service from a server. A single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database. 
	Server: A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls. A single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.
	Client Server Model: The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients requesting data or service from servers ans servers providing data or service to clients. 
	IP Address: An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4 addresses consist of four number separated by dots a.b.c.d where all four nmbers are between 0 and 255. Special values include: 
		127.0.0.1: Your own local machine. Also referred to as localhost. 
		192.168.x.y: Your private network. For instance, your machine and all machines on your private wifi network will usually have the 192.168 prefix.
	Port: In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the same machine without colliding, they pick a port to listen on. A port is an integer between 0 and 65535 (2^16 ports total).Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for system ports(also called well-known ports) and shouldn't be used by user-level processes. Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and although you usually won't be required to have them memorized, they can sometimes come in handy. Below are some examples: 
		22: Secure Shell. 
		53: DNS lookup. 
		80: HTTP.
		443: HTTPS.
	DNS: Short for Domain Name System, it describes the entities and protocols involved in the translation from domain names to IP Addresses. Typically, machines makes a DNS query to a well known entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones) of the requested domain name in the response.
