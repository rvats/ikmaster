The Problem Statement: Trending Topics
We are going to implement functionality similar to Trending Topics on Twitter:
What I know:
People Tweet, They add various HashTags to make their tweet trend.
When A certain percentage of twitter user are using the same hash tag in a given time frame: 
That topic trends
Disaster: Texas Power Failure: They are curating 

=================================================================================
Discuss with Interviewer(Clarifying Questions To Ask): 

Functional Assumptions:
	We are going to count number of HashTag is used to determine a trending topic
	
Functional Requirements:
	Going to have to look into creating Counter: 
	Key things here are: 
	HashTag
	Real time So time frame or time range: 5 Minutes
	Region Specific: 1 Million Users Percentage of Users 5%
	Consume Request (Visitor) from a message queue on an Aggregator machine
	Retrieve counter value

Design constraints:
	Rate of incoming Requests (Visitor)
	100000 Tweets per sec 30,000,000
	1 Million Users 5% of that will be 50,000
=================================================================================	
What Services We Need:
Existing Microservices:
Tweet Functionality 
Microservices Architecture Pattern: Scatter Gather


Tweet Comprises of HashTags We parsed them 
Database Key Value Store Each HashTag - (Counter)
New York Server(s) We have million user We have to calculate when Number of Users Using A particular HashTag reaches 50000
Reverse Indexing: Value of KV pair I defined above
