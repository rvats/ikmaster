System Design: 
The goal of interviewer in system design is
To see your breadth of problem solving 
Discussion amongst equals
Whether You are aware of real world problems and how different company are solving problems

As with any systems design interview question, the first thing that we want to do is to gather system requirements; we need to figure out what system we're building exactly.
