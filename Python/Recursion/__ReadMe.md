What expressions/(partial) solutions/combinations/permutations are there to consider?
Do we have to consider all expressions/(partial) solutions/combinations/permutations or can we exclude some?
How can we generate all those expressions/(partial) solutions/combinations/permutations?
Should we store all the generated expressions/(partial) solutions/combinations/permutations in memory?
How do we evaluate the expressions/(partial) solutions/combinations/permutations, if needed?
